## About Redux and Redux Toolkit

**Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, commonly used with React to manage application state in a centralized store. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments, and are easy to test.

**Redux Toolkit** is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It simplifies Redux development by providing utilities to reduce boilerplate code, streamline store setup, and handle common use cases like creating slices and async logic.

Key benefits of using Redux Toolkit:
- Simplifies store configuration and setup
- Reduces boilerplate with `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`
- Encourages best practices for Redux development
- Integrates well with modern React features
